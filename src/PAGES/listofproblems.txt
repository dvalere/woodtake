Incorrect Form Usage in the Guide Component:

The imageForm variable is defined in multiple files, which might be causing conflicts or misusage. Ensure you're using the correct form variable where needed.
Fix: Ensure you're importing and using the imageForm from the correct file.
Misplaced UI Logic in Landing and Guide Components:

The Guide and Landing components are expecting plzwork and imageee types in their props, but the props passed during rendering are not matching this structure.
Fix: Change the component signature to correctly handle props.
Incorrect useState Initialization in ViewingPost Component:

The ViewingPost component initializes state variables but does not update them, leading to an empty screen.
Fix: Ensure the state variables (imageUrl, description, identify) are updated with the correct values, either from props or via context.
Handling of Async Redis Operations:

Make sure Redis operations are correctly awaited and handled. Any issue here could cause the UI to wait indefinitely.
Fix: Ensure all Redis operations are correctly awaited and handle potential errors.
