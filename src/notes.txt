image is submitted

image goes to redis

image is placed in gallery grid

user is redirected to viewingPost

viewingPost displays the image by using usestate

imageblock objects or elements that hold viewingpage objects with the data of a post, they display the image of that post, and they’re clickable

imageBlock→viewingPage(usestate declared here)[imageForm within viewingPage]→redis

imageBlock elements can be placed on gallerypage just like it’s done in pixelary

useState in galleryPage, which goes through redis and adds new

```
    <hstack gap="small">{myDrawings}</hstack>

```

Data flow:
Landing at galllery page→guide page→image form→add to redis & update useState→viewingPost(relies on useState)

Gallery→galleryblocks(access redis, load up viewingPost page when clicked)



1. refactor form to use context.useForm
2. use post creation on form submission
3. use redis to associate post type and image with post ID
4. use data from redis to determine initial view


Post creation: 
Values are stored in redis
When whatever button is clicked, a function stores the post values into a type, and the return value of that function is inputted into a viewingPost page



AFTER FORM SUBMISSION:
-Create new "post" comment under the custom post:
    Post:
        Each comment is structured with the "viewingPost" page
        When the imageForm is submitted, a comment is made with the info
        Set enter the info into redis too, with the comment ID as the redis key
        
    Comments:
        You can click "guess" on a post and it'll open a form to enter what type of wood you think it is
        The guess will then show up on the comment of the original post as a reply
        The comments section will show upvotes and show the highest upvoted comments

Create a function that 

//ADD REDIRECTING TO THE NEW POST


GALLERY PAGES:
-I have a variable that holds the page number
-Everytime someone clicks on the up or down buttons to change between pages, the variable is added to or subtracted from
-The information for the image blocks are added into redis hsets with a "page number" value when they are inputted
-The page object runs a function that searches redis, and finds every hset with a page number that matches the current page number variable, and displays them in the blocks. With this, the blocks won't have to be in every page, but the states can update. 

variable in main that holds the amount of blocks available on the page
function in main that checks how many blocks are availabe, and then returns the number of the page that has an available block(it will use the availablePages variable, )
currentPage useState variable in main->


IMPORTANT:
-With the current structure of the gallery page navigation, it will have to be considered how the pages will update in tandem with redis when a post is deleted.
-Add a function within the onsubmit section of the imageForm to retrieve the user's username or ID 
-Add username value into redis hset
-Maybe add something to make it so the image blocks are invisible until an image is loaded into them?


Current problem: 
-Images don't update when a new one is submitted
-First 2 pages show the images, but when you try to keep clicking, it doesnt go forward, which is good, but the incrementation still happens.
-Page numbers in console logs are kind of-


Testing Page navigation:
-The 0 logs, so the console.log(pagenum) executes
