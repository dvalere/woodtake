image is submitted

image goes to redis

image is placed in gallery grid

user is redirected to viewingPost

viewingPost displays the image by using usestate

imageblock objects or elements that hold viewingpage objects with the data of a post, they display the image of that post, and they’re clickable

imageBlock→viewingPage(usestate declared here)[imageForm within viewingPage]→redis

imageBlock elements can be placed on gallerypage just like it’s done in pixelary

useState in galleryPage, which goes through redis and adds new

```
    <hstack gap="small">{myDrawings}</hstack>

```

Data flow:
Landing at galllery page→guide page→image form→add to redis & update useState→viewingPost(relies on useState)

Gallery→galleryblocks(access redis, load up viewingPost page when clicked)
